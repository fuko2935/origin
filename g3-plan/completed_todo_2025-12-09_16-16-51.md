# G3 Planner Requirements Review

## 1. Display Coach Feedback Content (Not Just Length)
- [x] Display first 25 lines of coach feedback content
- [x] Truncate with "..." indicator if feedback exceeds 25 lines
- [x] Keep showing char count as secondary info

## 2. TODO File Location and Preservation in Planning Mode
- [x] G3_TODO_PATH is set in run_coach_player_loop()
- [x] todo_write checks for planner mode before deletion
- [x] TODO file preserved for rename to completed_todo_*.md

## 3. Write GIT COMMIT Entry BEFORE Actual Commit
- [x] history::write_git_commit() called at line 485
- [x] git::commit() called at line 489 (AFTER history write)

## 4. Single-Line UI Updates During LLM Processing
- [x] print_status_line uses \r to overwrite previous line
- [x] notify_sse_received shows "Thinking..." status
- [x] print_tool_header clears status line and prints tool on new line
- [x] print_agent_response displays non-tool text messages

## 5. Write Logs to Workspace Path (Not Relative)
- [x] G3_WORKSPACE_PATH set in run_coach_player_loop()
- [x] get_logs_dir() checks G3_WORKSPACE_PATH first
- [x] All logging uses get_logs_dir()
